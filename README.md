# TheanoNeuralNetwork
A simple neural network built with Theano.  
The network predicts wether or not a student will be accepted into a university based upon their results from two exams.

## Dependencies

* Theano
* Numpy
* Pandas

Just Google how to install these packages if you don't have them. I use pip.

## Run

  python run.py
